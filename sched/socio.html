		<h2>ABOUT</h2>
		<p>This course is designed to provide students with a background to the sociological study of (mostly illegal) 
            drugs and drug use. As a sociology class, we will focus on drug use and abuse as social (not medical or 
            psychopathological/pharmacological) phenomena. 
            More specifically, we will discuss the history of drug use and regulatory efforts; the epidemiology of 
            drug use (including use patterns related to specific drugs); the relationships between drug use, 
            responses to drug use, and racism/class conflict; sociological perspectives on drug use/abuse/addiction; 
            social responses to drug use, including law enforcement, laws and policies, harm reduction, prevention, 
            and treatment.
            Most of this course will be focused on the US. This is a seminar class and students will have many 
            opportunities to engage deeply with the course material through class discussions, assignments, and a 
            small group research project and presentation. You may find that some of the material in class 
            challenges what you are used to thinking about drugs and drug use. Your opinions and life experiences 
            can have a place in your arguments, but they should not take center stage. Instead, the authors of the
            class readings and our discussions will model sociological ways of seeing things. Engaging with the 
            course materials will show me that you are practicing the new skills of sociological thinking. You do not 
            need to agree with a theoretical perspective to explain it or to practice using it!  </p>
